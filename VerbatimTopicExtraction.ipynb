      "I was sent this product for free to try and review, but all of these opinions are my own. This shampoo did seem to help with a dry scalp and some dandruff. However, it also seemed to make my hair more tangled. The smell was also VERY strong! It had almost a Vicks vapor rub smell to it. I enjoy more floral or berry smells, but if you enjoy essential oils you will most likely enjoy this scent :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

I know these products take a few uses to work so I will be interested to see improvements in the coming weeks. I am not thrilled with the smell. It's a little to herbal for me. I would prefer a fresh scent or maybe even a citrus or floral scent. I don't find that the scent faded through the day. It may just take some getting used to.

      "I recieved this for free from influenster in their complimentary voxbox, i have used a few of the other \"ever\" products and love those so i was pumped to try this!

      "I really enjoy their other line of EverPure products, but the Ever Fresh line, while it does work and helps my itchy scalp (especially during the winter), it smells absolutely horrible. It smells like I dumped an entire bottle of men's cologne in my hair, and while that's great for the men in our lives, for me not so much. I think I'll be giving these products to my boyfriend to try instead. \n",

      "Oh, the smell!!!! It is refreshing! My first time using the Head and Shoulders Tea Tree with Mint Shampoo I had some sinus congestion, the smell opened my sinuses. The tea tree was soothing to my small patch of psoriasis. My scalp feels much better and not as dry after just a few uses. I would definitely purchase this shampoo again.

      "First off this shampoo smells insanely refreshing, my hair gets so oily no matter what shampoo I use but after used this my hair wasn’t greasy and my flakes were not noticeable. It’s cooling right when it touches your scalp and feels so calming it’s like your giving yourself a scalp treatment that you would get from a spa. I also love that the tingling and smell comes from all natural oil! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I honestly always use this. I have eczema and my scalp gets very irritated and itchy if i use anyhing else. So i stick with what works for my sensitive skin.\n",

      "The smell is great! I get seasonal dandruff and always use this shampoo to help. It keeps the flakes away !\n",

      "My head itched like I had fleas. Seriously, it was driving me insane. Head & Shoulders stopped the itching from the dry scalp.\n",
      "Love the smell and that it actually stops the itching!!! It's worth it\n",
      "This shampoo and conditioning system isn't that bad compared to how the old system used to overly dry my scalp out. But, this type of system has the tendency to make my hair a bit more oilier faster than I would prefer. But, isn't as bad as the super oil infused ones are. It's a decent value for the price.\n",
      "I have purchased various kinds of dandruff shampoo, but the flakes never quite disappeared. I bought store brands and let me tell you, I will NEVER purchase the store brand again. I have used this 4 times and my flakes are GONE. My hair and scalp look GREAT! I received these products for an honest review and I am excited because I found a product that I will actually use.\n",

      "Has cut down on my dandruff and smells absolutely amazing. Love this.\n",
      "I'm a dude with a dry scalp, so I need Head & Shoulders to make me not gross to women. Nobody knows how to make a man smell attractive to women like Old Spice. Every man should use this stuff if they want any attention from the ladies (or men if that's your jam).\n",
      "I'm always skeptical of dandruff shampoos, like which work, which don't? The scent is subtle but pleasant, my hair seems thicker, the dry scalp had subsided a bit. I use it in my beard too since it seems more effective than standard soap. Will likely buy a new bottle when this one runs out.\n",
      "This smells great and it leaves my hair flake free.I enjoy the light tingle and the manly scent.Finally a Head and Shoulders that isn't medicine smelling.I received this free for my honest review.\n",

      "It has a pleasant scent for men and it is not overpowering. Doesn't burn the scalp like it used to.\n",
      "I am not normally a big fan of the old spice scent but this one is not bad. The scent is not over powering and pleasant.

      "I have horrible dandruff and dry scalp. When I use head and shoulders I don’t notice any flakes at all. My scalp feels great and doesn’t itch.\n",
      "It does help with dry scalp that's what I use for that it does help I'm having less Everytime I put some on it's good n it has a good scent n it feels good when u rub it in your hair\n",

      "I received this product to test and it was just AMAZING! I normally have oily hair and my scalp can get very itchy especially now that it's hot. After the first wash, I was pleasantly surprised at how my scalp immediately wasn't itchy anymore. I also love the minty smell of the shampoo without giving you that cool tingly feeling. I received this product in exchange for an honest review!\n",
      "Head and Shoulders is a great product. I feel like I can switch between this and my regular shampoo to maintain a flake free scalp. The tee tree oil smells amazing in this shampoo and leaves a tingly feeling! I loved it!\n",

      "no dandruff, pleasant scent, feels good\n",
      "By far the best of the head and shoulders products. The tea tree has a cooling effect on the scalp that really seems to help me. And it's a lot cheaper on Amazon than in any store I've seen so far.\n",
      "Really good for oily scalps and is not drying for the hair. I have a very oily scalp and sometimes have to repeat the shampoo though even with this special oily formula.  The price on here seems to fluctuate wildly although I was able to grab it when it dropped a little.\n",
      "more dandruff for me!!\n",
      "Helps with oily scaly spots on scalp more than the original head and shoulders.\n",
      "Instant relief for my scalp. I will be buying this product again! And it smells great so that's a bonus!\n",
      "This stuff helps with the flakes so I always think of it as a medicinal sort of shampoo, but there's nothing medicinal about the smell or feel of this shampoo. It smells and feels like any normal shampoo when you use it. I found the smell to be fairly weak, so it's good for those sensitive to smell since there isn't much to contend with.\n",
      "I don't know why people are so crazy about this stuff. It did nothing on the thickening side. It smells OK...and must help some with dandruff. I would say use Nizoral if you want to have more dense looking hair.\n",
      "Saved my scalp!\n",
      "I never write reviews but Head and Shoulders with Almond oil is a miracle in a bottle. My scalp was so dry but after using this for about a week my scalp is back to normal Thanks again Head and Shoulers!!\n",
      "I love this shampoo. I didn't seem to have dandruff but my scalp was so itchy. After I started to use this the itchiness is much better. More importantly I love the way my hair feels. It is SO SILKY. I have very fine limp hair and I think this has \"perked\" it up. Love it.\n",
      "I hate to give a bad review but this product simply did nothing to clarify my scalp. I was rooting for it and just sad. Also, the scent doesn't smell almondy to me. Sorry guys :(\n",
      "So if you have dandruff, like many of us do, you will love Head and Shoulders. However, as someone with colored hair, I was not pleased to see my color leave along with the shampoo down the drain. So if you have colored hair, stay away!\n",
      "I definitely tend to have a drier scalp, and alternating this shampoo with my regular hair wash routine has decreased the dryness and itching to almost nothing! I love that it has almond oil in it. It also smells great - not too strong. This product was sent to me for free and I'm giving my honest opinion about the product.\n",

      "I absolutely love the almond scent! Helps with an itchy scalp for sure but I haven't really suffered from dandruff recently so I can't say if it helps with that. I received this for free in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "This was a nice shampoo that smelled nice and left my scalp feeling very moisturized and less itchy. I only wish it were more curl friendly. I feel that it weighed my curls down a bit but it was definitely good for my scalp. I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.\n",
      "I was eager to try this product when I received it complimentary for testing purposes for Influenster. I was having a small dandruff problem prior to recieving this product. After literally one use, that problem vanished. I haven't seen any flakes since the first time I used this product. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a dandruff problem. It also has a nice smell to it.\n",

It is light and doesn't weigh my h air down. Really helps with the itching also! I got this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review!\n",
      "I recently tried the head and shoulders dry scalp shampoo and my opinion is that while its a good shampoo and does what it says, if you dont have dry hair it will leave your hair very oily. But overall a good shampoo. I recieved this product free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "Let me first say that I do not have dandruff or a dry scalp, so I have never felt the need to use any head and shoulders products.

      "Since moving to TX from the east coast, I've suffered from itchy dry flaky scalp! The most irritating issue is the itch. I hate scratching in public. Once I started using the H&S almond oil shampoo it has dramatically cut down the itch factor. And let's face it less scratching= less flakes! Great product! I received this product free for reviewing purposes. My opinions are 100% honest and unbiased\n",
      "I have used the original Head and Shoulders as needed before and stopped after my dandruff was done. I received this product from Influenster and have been enjoying it! I LOVE the smell and I feel like my hair has been very happy when using it! I'm looking forward to continue using it and I actually might want to try some of the other lines!\n",
      "I haven't even used this product for a week and I'm not seeing any flakes now and my scalp doesn't feel as dry as it used to. There's a tiny medicated smell from the bottle but it doesn't carry over to the hair. I think anyone should try this product if they have any dandruff or have even a minor dryness to their scalp. I need to mention I tried this for free but these are my actual opinions.\n",
      "The best thing about this shampoo is that it doesn't have a medicinal smell like some dandruff shampoos. I have not had any problems with dandruff or an itchy scalp since I started using it.

      "The smell for this clinical strength is so bad that I rather trash both than dealing with repackage, return and refund. Not even my good smell conditioner could masked the smell of orange color (Blue 1, Yellow 5.) selenium sulfide. The ingredient claims they added Fragrance but what ever this \"Fragrance\" come from need to be go back up Satan's colon after he pig out on several dozens rotten devil eggs. I got both bottles for really dirt cheap price and i hope some landfill's rat out there rocking a dandruff free fur\n",

      "Bye bye dandruff\n",
      "Strangely, this product leaves a dry and almost hard coating on the top of my scalp after each use, even after a thorough rinse. This has not occurred with other brands containing selenium sulfide. In general, I tend to rotate monthly between products with selenium sulfide and zinc pyrithione to treat dandruff.\n",
      "The only product that actually gets rid of my dandruff. Nothing else quite cuts it.\n",

      "This shampoo has successfully gotten rid of the little dandruff I had, I didn't really need clinical strength as I only have little dandruff. I have a dry scalp and it works for me. It is definitely different from the normal head and shoulders. My only complaint is the smell, it smells like Dial gold soap which I hate.  Head & Shoulders® Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo 90mL Bottle [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This clinical strength head and shoulders shampoo has been wonderful for my dandruff, if you can stand the smell. It lasts for days and keeps my head from itching and flaking but the medicated smell lasts for a while too. For me the smell turns my stomach and I get a big whiff of it periodically. Besides that smell this product is absolutely wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "The only shampoo my husband can/will use to control his dry scalp & dandruff.  I like it too but wish it had a more fresh or clean smell.\n",
      "Seems to help with minor skin flaking but H&S definitely needs to adjust the fragrance.   The strong plastic smell even after thorough rinsing definitely is not a good thing to walk around in public with.\n",

      "I usually have very dry hair and a very dry scalp. This product made my scalp feel so much relief in just one wash. The smell wasn't my favorite\n",
      "I’ve been having mega flaky scalp the past few months and the normal Head and Shoulders hasn’t been working like it used to. It got so bad it was like it was snowing every time I ruffled my hair. Tried this a few days ago, and it immediately got rid of the flakes! Love it!!\n",
      "Head and Shoulders Clinical Solutions for itchy scalp and redness is really working.  I'm noticing several days of non-itching between shampoos.\n",
      "Will continue to use for scalp relief.\n",
      "What you would need to know before you go on ahead and purchase this product is that, this shampoo is a clinical strength shampoo, (that doesn't mean its a cure because it is a shampoo after all), it works extremely well for dandruff and scalp issues, I have myself a case of dandruff, that makes it look like its snowing in july if I itch my head. The smell might not be all that fantastic, but it isn't supposed to smell great, its a clincal strength shampoo, so the emphasis is on helping curb the issues, if you're worrying about the smell, you can always wash your head with a shampoo that you like the smell of after you apply the clinical shampoo. While I was using this product, my dandruff has noticely improved, now its not so much white when I itch my head on occasion. So I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has dandruff/scalp issues\n",
      "I absolutely loved this. I have tried many dandruff shampoos and none worked as fast as this one. Also the smell is much better compared to some of other products that I have used. I instantly felt relief on my scalp and had basically zero flakes. I would for sure recommend this product to anyone that suffers with a dry scalp and dandruff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I've used it for a week and half now, my dandruff is gone also the itchiness is gone as well. My head feels well i would say. It does have a strong smell to it but nothing you cant handle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have some light dandruff and this shampoo was able to get rid of that completely. It works really well. After using it just a couple times over the course of a week, I didn't have any more dandruff at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem I had with it was the smell. It smells nice and citrusy at first, but once I washed it out it smelled sort of chemically and weird. The smell went away pretty quickly, but it was still unpleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I finally found the solutions for dandruff and itchy scalp that I have been dealing with, I will be continue to buy this product again!\n",
      "I got this more for my wife to try than myself as she is the one that tends to suffer from dry, flaky scalp, but I also wanted to give it a shot just to see what it was like. I tried it before she had a chance to and wasn't a big fan of the smell that lingered in my hair after using it that first time. I went ahead and had her give it a try just to see if it's something that perhaps she'd like to try versus another brand she currently uses of the same type of shampoo. After trying it, she too decided that the smell was too pungent and lingered in her hair  too long to not want to continue using it further. It may work well, but we'll never know due to the simple fact we both couldn't get past the smell.\n",
      "I have used this product for a little more than a week and I must say, the itching, the flaking all is gone my hair feels great and im not embarrassed to wear black shirts anymore, I'm definitely buying another bottle and using it as a maintenance shampoo.\n",
      "After several weeks of use I have started to notice my scalp feels dried out.  I am becoming less and less impressed with this shampoo.\n",
      "I'm usually hesitant to spend a lot of money on shampoo, but the Head & Shoulders Clinical Solutions Anti-Dandruff Shampoo was fantastic. It cleared up dandruff quickly and left my hair feeling great.\n",
      "Prior to receiving the product, I wanted to know if this is a true clinical product and if it actually worked, having used multiple anti-dandruff products that didn't work. I notice I have a singificant amount of dandruff when I get my haircut. I noticed this time around there is a great reduction in dandruff! Great product!\n",
      "Got to try this for free from bzz campaign.  Works good, kept dandruff away.. hard to explain the fragrance, in between a chemical and flowery smell.\n",
      "Avoid contact with eyes. Burns worse than regular shampoo\n",
      "I think that head and shoulders is great at keeping the dandruff outta my head and it gives a nice shine to my hair this is something I will be purchasing again in the future.\n",
      "I really gotta tell you folks if there's something you wanna know about Head and Shoulders Clinical Solutions Anti-Dandruff Shampoo here it is For me it smells really good have not had an itch or a flake past the 7 days of usage my scalp gets that tingly feeling after every use I have very little but what I do have has that soft clean feeling every time if you're having doubts about buying have no worries this product stands up to its long time name Head and Shoulders no other brand can come close Thank you for another innovative product\n",
      "This shampoo does what it describes, including dandruff relief but also cured my dry scalp. Granted, I don't suffer from a terribly dry or flaky scalp, but I did notice a relief in the daily itch from wearing a hat all day. I personally liked the smell of it; however, my wife would prefer it to have either a more gender-neutral scent, or obviously more feminine.\n",
      "I've had a slight itch with minimal dandruff and it hasn't gone away yet.  Perhaps it needs time, but Bzz desperately wants me to finish this review.  The shampoo has a weird but minimal smell and it's color is off-putting.  It looks like I'm putting Russian salad dressing in my hair.\n",
      "Been using Head and Shoulders Clinical Solution for over a week now and have notice a reduction is a dry and itchy scalp.  I keep my hair short so it's important that I don't have any dandruff.  The only thing that will get a little getting use to is the smell.   That could be something that could be improved on but I will take no flakes over smell.\n",
      "I dont have the worst dandruff, but i tend to wear a lot of dark shirts and simply dont like little specks of dead scalp visible.  For me, i only use once or twice a week and my regular shampoo the rest of the time, but i guess everyone is different.  will definately keep on purchasing Head & Shoulders Clinical Solutions Anti-Dandruff Shampoo...at least until i get old and go  bald :)\n",
      "My parents were in town recently and had complained that it was extremely dry in  my house and that they were itching all over.  Even though my parents don't have a dandruff issue, I figured why not let them use the H&S shampoo.  After a couple of days, they said they seem to itch less.  Whether or not not that is due to the shampoo or not, I'm not sure.\n",
      "This product acts differently than other shampoos and takes some getting used to.  Should only use when you have an issue with dandruff.\n",
      "Before using head and shoulders I had a small amount of dandruff. After trying for only 7 days the problem is completely gone. I would recommend this to anyone who is skeptical about buying it. Go ahead and make the purchase you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "I have extremely bad dandruff and normal T gels don't even work. I was hoping for some relief since this is clinical strength but it was just the same as if I was using normal shampoo. And may I add that normal shampoo smells a lot better too. And I should add that i used this for over a week with no change in dandruff.\n",
      "it the best I ever used left my hair with a shine no flacks get smell  get is all I can say I would buy it any time  not just for dandruff control I wiil use it all the time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I got this for my girfriend who has been battling with dandruff for some time.  Everything she has tried has not helped, so I thought this could work.  \n",
      "Her first reaction while using it was that it smells like chemicals (And that it isn't sulfate free....whatever that means).  Her thought was that if it smells this bad it better work.\n",
      "After her shower she blow dried her hair and it still had a slight chemical smell.  After a day, she didn't notice any change in her dandruf.  Maybe  more treatment would have helped, but she couldn't get past them smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "As I saw in another review, this product works great the day of use. If you skip a day of use, the dandruff does return. I still think that it is better than the regular version of this shampoo brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Every time is used this shampoo my hair was flake free afterward.  Full disclosure: if I didn't wash my hair everyday (with this shampoo) my flakes came back with a vengeance.  I'm inclined to say this shampoo helps maintain a clear scalp with routine use.  It doesn't eliminate the problem completely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have tried the Head & Shoulders Clinical Solutions Anti-Dandruff Shampoo.  I cannot get past the smell of the shampoo.  It has a strong odor of sulfur.  This may be a common ingredient in dandruff shampoos, but I have never noticed this strong of an odor before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I finally got to try the Head & Shoulders Clinical Solutions Anti-Dandruff Shampoo when my package came in. I was excited to try it as I do have a slight dandruff issue. After using it for a few days, it seemed to cut form my woes! Just a little dollup did the trick. The only downside was the scent takes a little getting used to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This product worked great for me. I had previously tried other brands with no success, but after about 2 uses of this product I was dandruff free. You have to make sure that you work the product into your scalp and leave it in your hair for a couple/few minutes before rinsing it out in order for it to work. I had a very dry scalp with redness, itching and flakes before using this product and now I am good as new again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I shave my hair very short, so have had a problem with very dry scalp! This seems to be the only Shampoo so far that has been able to help. The Smell is amazing as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have used the Head & Shoulders clinical solutions only a handful of times and so has my fiancé. I can't tell you if it does or does not work because of the horrible smell! It smells pleasant at first but one you rinse it out it there is a really bad acid smell! My fiancé said she would rather have dandruff then smell like that! I planned to let her daughters try it but my fiancé said that would be mean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "My scalp has took a turn for the better. I've seen it change over the past few weeks as there became less and less dandruff appearing on my clothes. I only with there wereally more scents. The scent they have does smell good though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

      "If you are after a strong solution to dandruff, this could be your best choice.  However if your case isn't severe, I would stick with some of the other head and shoulder varieties that don't have such a strong aroma and seem less medicinal.

      "I don't normally have dandruff, but sometimes I do get itchy scalp. I was worried that this stuff would smell like medicine but I honestly didn't mind. I liked the little bit of tingle this gave my scalp, kinda reminded me of tea tree oil.  I've only used it a couple of times but my head really hadn't itched since. Not too bad!

      "I have been using Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo for about a week.  So far it seems to do what it supposed to.  I did not really have flaking with my previous shampoo but there was some scalp itching.  This itching has been reduced since using Head and Shoulders,  I have also noticed that during and after shampooing prior shampoo. I would recommend it.

      "I used Heads and Shoulders Clinical truth yesterday. The first thing I noticed was the scent which is good. The second thing I noticed was how easy it was to dispense and its thickness. Lastly I noticed was the amount of dirt coming out of hair and that my itchy scalp had stopped. I was very pleased with the sheen too that my hair exhibited after drying. Overall this is a product that I would use and recommend . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have used head and shoulders for years. I live in he desert so it's kind of necessary. I have a very itchy scalp. I was excited when Dove came out with this shampoo and conditioner so I bought both. Well it is horrrible. It made my scalp SO much itchier. I actually called Dove and they refunded me and asked me to send them back to them. I would not recommend.\n",

      "I do not normally have dandruff, so couldn't evaluate that aspect of this product.  I also do not normally have an itchy scalp so I wasn't able to determine how much this product helped.  I was not crazy about the scent of this shampoo plus I found the orange color a bit off-putting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have been using the shampoo for a week and I have already seen my dandruff to be minimal. Seems positive so far and need more time to determine its usefulness. The color of the shampoo seems a bit strange, I assume it's the specific chemical mix but it's not what I would expect out of a shampoo. The smell is hard to explain but could use some additional scent. I might be over analyzing it as essentially it's in the name, clinical... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

I got to try this product for free but my opinions are all my own!\n",

      "I’ve been using these products for many years; dandruff is an annoying problem to have, especially when most of my tops are black.

      "My hair is dry and frizzy, with a very itchy flaky scalp. I do like that this shampoo has a refreshing green apple scent. It helps to mask the typical chemical smell of dandruff shampoos. This shampoo did help my scalp a lot. To note, I have received this shampoo and conditioner for free from Influenster to try out and review. However, all opinions are my own. Since I started washing my hair with it, dandruff is much improved.\n",

Due to this complicated combination I have been unable to find a good dandruff shampoo because most are heavy and make my hair greasy. This is not the case with this shampoo! I absolutely love it. It feels light and refreshing while absolutely helping with my dandruff. Since starting to use the shampoo and conditioner combo about a week ago my hair has been almost completely flake free! \n",

      "Let me start off by saying I have a very dry scalp which causes dandruff no matter how many times I wash or add oil in my hair. After trying Head & Shoulders new green apple shampoo I noticed a difference. It has a great scent which is important to me as I love to smell good. The shampoo had a clean finish leaving my scalp feeling relieved. I would recommend this product to people who also have dandruff issues. I tested Head & Shoulders for free, but all opinions are your own.\n",

      "I Recieved this as a product testing from influenster and I must say that it made my hair a little smoothe, I just don't like the concept of the green apple smell because it's so strong. I can definitely see why it was rated #1 for no flakes\n",
      "First time getting the Green Apple Collection,  it does leave your hair smelling fresh a good, the smell is alright i like green apples so i enjoy the smell. But i haven't yet used it for long to see if it's helping me with my dry scalp. I got this product free for complimentary for testing purposes.\n",

      "I have struggled with dandruff my entire life.  I have tried more shampoos than I can count.  Some have helped a little bit, others have made it worse.  I have been using this for a couple months now, and my dandruff is COMPLETELY gone.  Dandruff is an allergy, so I have to keep using it, but I can now run my fingers through my hair, and it feels amazing!  The biggest reason I left this review is because I'll never use another shampoo at this point, and I hope it continues to be available.  If you struggle with dandruff, give this a try.\n",

      "I was pleasantly surprised by this product. First, I have a sensitivity to sacylic acid that normally prevents me from using these products...this one doesn't contain it,so I was able to try it. I loved the smell,fresh and summery and it controlled the itch longer than similiar products. I will use again * I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "Reminds me of the old school herbal essences Apple scent. It's a nice change from the traditional smell of dandruff shampoo! And there's really nothing that can beat the dandruff fighting power of Head & Shoulders :)\n",
      "Smells DELICIOUS! Also helps with itching and flakiness.\n",
      "Absolutely love the smell. Helps with itchy and dandruff and all their products do.\n",
      "It has a nice scent especially compared to typical dandruff shampoos, but I've never had luck with Head and Shoulders in getting rid of dandruff. I received this product for free for testing, but my opinion is my own.\n",
      "So, I have a very bad issue with my scalp. my hair, I'm not too worried about but my scalp is in need of some desperate care. As soon as I opened the bottle, the smell overwhelmed me. it smelled so good. And after using it, my scalp felt free of irritation and flakes. I cannot not believe it\n",
      "I tested Head & Shoulders for free, but all opinions are my own\n",
      "I love Head and Shoulders, it gets rid of dandruff very very well. The scent is amazing too, definitely recommend this! 10/10 I recieved green apple complimentary for reviewing purposes.\n",
      "This was my first time trying a Head-and-Shoulders product, or even a 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner. The smell was okay, chemical mixed with a pleasant apple. I didn't have dandruff to start, so I can't speak to the efficacy of the product in that sense. When paired with additional conditioner, it was a fine shampoo. (Recieved product free).\n",
      "I used this product for 2 weeks straight and it really changed the way my scalp felt. The flakes were less and less each day and now none. I love the smell. Will use again and recommend\n",
      "The product is like any other head and shoulders 2 in 1 dandruff control shampoo and conditioner, but what distinguishes it is the green apple smell. I love it! Would definitely recommend this product. It smells amazing, so light and fresh. I can be a little sensitive to scents, especially in the morning. I got this free from Influenster to review.\n",
      "I wasn't able to use it due to my hair care routine but my brother who gets dandruff pretty bad has used almost the entire bottle. It has a very light apple smell (I like strong shampoos and conditioners), the green color is nice and since using I could tell my brother's scalp isn't as flaky as usual. I tested Head & Shoulders for free, but all opinions are mine\n",
      "This really helps with my dry and itchy scalp. I have seborrheic dermatitis and this is a must for me to have!!\n",
      "I'm not usually a head and shoulders user just because I don't have an issue with dandruff, but the shampoo seems to work well and smells great\n",
      "I have very thick and oily hair, I also have bad dandruff, after using Head\n",
      "The scent of this shampoo is by far the best part! Not only does this leave my hair feeling light and flake-free, but it smells lovely all day! I love the convenience of the one bottle, less clutter in my already crowded shower. I received my bottle as a free sample to try and now it's a staple of my shopping list!\n",
      "I began using the product which I received as a free sample to try and review, from Influenster. I used until it was gone & I am pleased to say that it has cleared up all of my dandruff. I have black hair so the flakes definitely show and I haven't seen any at all. My scalp is also less sensitive, as I am not itching all the time. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for help with dandruff.\n",
      "I had used head and shoulders many times in the past but hadn't in years because I didn't enjoy the \"medicinal\" sort of smell it had. This green apple sent is great! My scalp can range from dry to oily and this seems to do the trick! Even though it's technically a dandruff shampoo it's still great to use when you don't necessarily need to clear up dandruff.\n",
      "I always keep Head & Shoulders in my beauty arsenal for when I start to see flakes! I really liked this new scent, which is a lighter green apple and very refreshing! I am not typically a fan of fruity scents, but its more like an apple orchard i spring than a piece of candy! I used it for one week, and not a flake in sight! I tested H & S for free, but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "This product smells wonderful! It leaves your hair lingering with that great green apple smell. I also love that it is a shampoo and conditioner because it saves time in the shower. It also keeps dandruff at bay which can be a problem for someone with a dry scalp.\n",
      "This product is awesome. I love the green apple smell. It isn't too strong, but just right. And after just two uses, dandruff is gone. I received this product as a promotion, but this in no way affected my opinion of the product.\n",
      "I haven't always looked to this brand for shampoo but I had the opportunity to try it for free, however these opinions are my ownand it had helped my dry scalp\n",
      "I got this product free to try. I absolutely loved it. It makes my hair smell so good unlike some dandruff shampoos. After using this shampoo/conditioner I've been able to keep my dandruff under control.\n",
      "This shampoo is great for dry and/or oily hair that suffers from dandruff. It smells really nice so thats a plus.\n",
      "Effectively gets rid of dandruff every time.  Good scent.\n",
      "I received this product complimentary to review.\n",
      "I have a dry scalp which tends to get itchy, but this product not only relieves the itchy but helps heal my scalp. Also smells good so that's a plus.\n",
      "Great product. My scalp is usually dry and flacky and with this product so far it has helped. & it has only been 1 week!\n",
      "The color is orange and it doesn't have a nice smell, but it works. I had dandruff for a while and I decided to pick this up and I have been using it for a couple of months and I no longer see the flakes in my hair at all.\n",
      "This shampoo is the only shampoo that is doing anything for my sebhorreic dermatitis. Sometimes I'll use it as a body wash as well as a shampoo if I'm showering after a long, sweaty day or if my dermatitis flares up somewhere other than my scalp.\n",
      "I have very long thick curly hair & very sensitive scalp. This shampoo prevents my scalp from getting any infections. I love the smell and the orange color.\n",
      "I received this product free or complimentary in your review, but all opinions are your own. With that being said I love head and shoulders. Esp as a person that struggles with a dry scalp. It may just be my body but I found I adjusted after about a month of use and it didn't keep dandruff away. For other people like me, I have to wing on and off different shampoos since my body/skin adjusts so quickly.\n",
      "I have experienced slight dandruff and this product along with the shampoo helps eliminate that. It smells nice and does not buildup on my scalp. I have received this product free for review but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "I finally found a dandruff shampoo with a matching conditioner!\n",
      "I recieved this in a VoxBox for reviewing purposes. I love the smell and feeling of the almond conditioner! My scalp felt so good even after 2 days of not washing my hair! Will definitely purchase again!\n",
      "Been SLS/cone-free for a while. This contains SLS & cones. Massaged shampoo into wet hair & scalp, felt incredibly nice. Had great 1st day hair, but scalp got itchy the next day. I can go 2 days w/out washing but didn't even last a day. If you're sensitive to sulfates or silicones, NOT for you. I received this product for free from Influenster for testing, but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "I received this product for free through Influenster, all opinions are my own. I am currently taking a medication which causes my skin to be dry, including my scalp. I don't expect it to do much, because the dry scalp is a side effect of my medication. The bottle size is a bit small. The smell is actually pretty good.\n",
      "I received Head and Shoulders free to sample, but all of my opinions are my own. As of the last two months, I have been trying to wash my hair less and less. That being said, my scalp cries for moisture on the days whenever I normally don't shampoo. After using this Head and Shoulders, however, I was able to go multiple days with no shampoo and I didn't have the ugly flakes form a dry scalp.\n",
      "I suffer from an itchy scalp. I received this free to try in the mail from Influenster and I have to say, that my scalp hasn't itched all week. No way would this ever pass as a 2in1 conditioner success. In fact, I sometimes find it hard to spread through my scalp and hair b/c it makes my hair more dry feeling but it does help stop the itch and that is my overall goal.\n",
      "I have really dry scalp and I seriously can't live without this shampoo + conditioner. It keeps my scalp hydrated and it has a clean and fresh scent. *I tested this product for free but the opinions are my own*\n",
      "I was lucky enough to try the head and shoulders 2-1 for free for the past month. I've had scalp issues for years, and when I first had them I used head and shoulders. Weird to say though I feel like my head gets used to the formula and stops working as well. But the 2-1 I don't believe is made for people who have long hair like me. I believe I need to 2 part system to really get at my dry scalp.\n",
      "This is the only shampoo I can use! I have really bad dry scalp and this is the only thing that works for me..\n",
      "The product controls dandruff and relieves the itching. However, for some reason it's making my curls look weird. Some of my hair will be curly, while the other half is kind of frizzy. Product is still good though. I tested this product for free, but it is my own opinion.\n",
      "I received this as a free sample to try and my husband and I have both been using it. Upon first use I really loved the way it smelled. Most dandruff shampoos have a strange scent. Like most shampoo + conditioner products it helped a little with the tangles but I think you're better off using two separate products.\n",
      "If I shower too much, I get dandruff. If I don't shower enough, I also get dandruff. Trying to find that balance of showering just the right amount and using Head & Shoulders. It seems like one of the standard shampoos for dandruff. I also use the coal tar kind once in awhile. I tested Head & Shoulders for free, but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "This product is wonderful. After just one use my scalp already felt better! I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. I plan to purchase more from the store!\n",
      "I received this as a complementary product to try from influencer. I have used it previously and was not paid for my review. I enjoy this 2in1 because it smells good and it actually leaves my hair being able to be combed through without extra conditioner. It also make my hair flake free.\n",
      "This shampoo and conditioner smells awesome! I've had a problem with dandruff most of my life, usually a day or two after washing my hair, but it's been 6 days and no dandruff.\n",
      "My scalp was a bit itchy, dry, and flaky so I decided to try out some of the Head and Shoulders products and this 2-in-1 definitely relieved everything. My scalp is not nearly as itchy or flaky. I tested the product for free but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "This product not only helps keep away the flakes, it leaves your hair smelling great.\n",
      "After I'm done with week long hiking trip in Washington mountain range, I was informed about some alarming white flakes that had appeared after not showering and wearing beanies for a week. I used Head & Shoulders and No more greasy dandruff ridden matted whatever it is that took residence on my head.I tested Head & Shoulders for free, but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "This product actually reduces the dandruff I usually get. I highly recommend this product to others having similar issues with their hair.\n",
      "Let's be honest, who hasn't ever used #HeadandShoulders at least one time or another in their life? I know it's pretty much a staple in my shower...it's the only shampoo my bf uses and I do occasionally use it as well, especially in the winter time when my scalp starts dry out and feel itchy. *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes\n",
      "Leaves my scalp feeling great and my hair smells delicious after using.\n",
      "This is a product that I always seem to go back to. For years now this brand has been in and out of my hair care routine. My scalp gets dry and flakey all year around and this does the trick to clear that right up! I did just recently receive this in my Influenster VoxBox (for free, for testing) but I have previously used this product in the past and all opinions are my own!\n",
      "Left my hair feeling smooth, I would totally use this shampoo as a all the time shampoo! I would totally recommend for someone with dry scalp.\n",
      "This shampoo is alright. It doesnt do the very best job of making your hair feel nice, but it has gotten rid of a lot of my dandruff so i do recommend.\n",
      "Definitely adds volume to your hair! While leaving your scalp feeling refreshed! Love the scent so does my bf\n",
      "Whenever my dandruff is really bad this shampoo always seems to help. I would reccomend yo anyone looking for over the counter solution\n",
      "I get occasional dry scalp and this helps instantaneously. I use it maybe once a month for the cold season and it literally solves all of my scalp issues!\n",
      "This shampoo saved me from my dandruff in a week! This shampoo made my hair look great, feel great, and my favorite, flake free!\n",
      "I like head and shoulders for its smell. Howevever it doesn’t do much for dandruff. And I need a lot of product for it to even work.\n",
      "This shampoo helped with some dandruff that I was getting plus it made my hair look full and volumized even without any finishing products. I would recommend this is you want some good volume and have issues with dandruff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "The only shampoo I can use that keeps my dandruff and itchy scalp at bay! I would recommend!\n",
      "As something with fine, dry hair (along with a dry scalp), I found that using this shampoo helped add volume to my hair and didn't leave my scalp itchy.  It also has a clean scent to it, without being overwhelming.  I would make a repurchase for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have finally found a shampoo that I am not allergic to!  I am able to use this shampoo without my scalp breaking out and this is such a relief. Not only does my hair look better, but my scalp feels and looks better than ever before. It has a slight increase in volume and my hair looks shiny. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I love Head and Shoulders! So I was already excited about this product I got. It has a really nice smell to it and my dandruff is deffiently better than normal. My head feels less itchy the longer I wait to wash it than before. I would deffiently recommend this product to anybody. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I have a very dry scalp and I have tried head & shoulders before, but I feel like this formula has really helped my scalp. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This product smells so good. I have not used the volume version yet because I have thick curly hair. My waves get flat at times. This definitely gets rid if the itchy scalp and my curls waves showed more. My roots also weren't as flat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Love this shampoo! I noticed more volume after I used it. It has a great smell and it has helped with flakes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Every few months my scalp will get really dry and flaky and I always turn to this. It really helps and leaves me flake free. Great price and product.\n",
      "I recieved this product by influenster to give my honest review on it, I have really dry scalp and I have been using this for a while already and it has helped me alot!! I recommend this product to everyone that is dealing with dryness and dandruff.\n",
      "I got this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. First off the smell of this one is amazing! It smells almost like jolly ranchers. This product does well to get rid of flakes. Without leave your hair heavy and greasy. I will use this product again.\n",
      "This is my favorite anti-dandruff shampoo due to the fact that it conditions my hair so well that it doesn't frizz my curls\n",
      "My hair is frizz and in winter time I have scalp itching and dandruff when I use this shampoo helps me with everything including the frizz\n",
      "I use Head and shoulders a lot bc I have really bad dandruff but it doesn't get rid of my dandruff all the way .\n",
      "Overrated. I tried this only because I have an itchy scalp. It didn’t work and I think it made it worse\n",
      "This is nice for if you have a dry scalp, but it doesn't do much for any other part of your hair.  I find that there are better products to use for dry scalp that will also address my other hair concerns.\n",
      "Great product. Really helped my itchy scalp. Will definitely use this more after this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Smells amazing first off! I struggle with dry scalp and most dandruff shampoos smell chemically. This one smells so good! Scalp didn't itch and hair looks good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

      "This Shampoo is always the best !\n",
      "The herbal composition helps heals from scalp ish , it s anti pellicule , great on dry hair ! :D\n",
      "I received this in exchange for an honest review from influenster.  This product helped soothe my dry scalp while not weighing down my already fine hair.  I was not overly keen on the scent, as I'm not a lavender fan.  If you don't mind lavender scented products you may enjoy this scent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would purchase this product again if it were in an alternate scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Someone recommended this shampoo to me when I had dandruff and really I hated it!! I think it made it worst or maybe that's what it seemed to me at that time .  I tossed the bottle away ..\n",
      "Lavender is what’s great my dry scalp\n",

      "I never suffered from an itchy scalp until just recently and it just about drove me nuts! I really feel for those of you that have suffered with it for a long period of time. \n",
      " Anyhoo, after a bit of research (reading tons of reviews) I decided to give this Head and Shoulders a try, and low and behold it worked! I couldn't believe it, after shampooing with it just one time the itchiness was gone, woo-hoo! H\n",

      "I had dandruff problems for years, this product ended the misery in my hair.\n",
      "I received this shampoo and conditioner complimentary for review. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of anything green apple scented, so I gave it to my husband. He does not have dry scalp/dandruff so can not speak to that effect, but he likes it and the smell too. I frequently purchase  Head and Shoulders (the other scents) and I would recommend it.\n",
      "After trying many shampoos (to no avail), I finally found one that is kind to my scalp...no scaling, no irritation, no breakouts.  It really works!!\n",
      "I tested this product for free but all the opinions are my own. This was a nice product and definitely helped with my dandruff, but it isn't a cure-all. You're still going to have small issues with dandruff. Additionally because I have curly hair I can't use this as often as I probably need to to sustain use.\n",
      "I received this shampoo complimentary to test and review. I gave it to my pops and he said the following: Using a small amount produces good lathering and gives out a refreshing aromatic scent. Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Dandruff Shampoo has improved my dry scalp with each additional wash and I plan to continue using it after this bottle is done.\n",

He gave him complet immediate refill on all his issues!\n",
      "I've tried many, many dandruff shampoos and this was the worst. Don't waste your money. It actually made me more itchy. Try Nizoral instead. It's worth the extra money and you'll have relief in just one or two uses.\n",
      "Treated my dandruff after 3rd use.\n",
      "I was really excited to use this product but unfortunately it made my scalp extra dry and more flaky than ever. So now I have to figure out a new solution because now my scalp is even worse than when I started out using this. It also has a strong smell so your hair will smell like the smell also. Very disappointed\n",
      "smell isn't bad, seems to be helping with scalp\n",
      "After having eczema related dandruff for years, this has been the first product to get rid of it and keep it gone now for 6 months! Try it, you won’t regret it.\n",

      "One thing i must point out is it irritates my eyes, im not sure if its the mint part of it being too strong but it irritates my eyes so much. maybe ill give another one of there new products a go but i tried this one because i like a minty smell in my hair products.\n",
      "Great product. Tried many other products for my dry scalp and this is the only one tgat works.\n",
      "Like it. Removed the itch\n",
      "I tried the product in my son hair, and I like how it made his hair look and feel. It was shiny, he said it had a tingling feel, that he liked. It smelled wonderful. No dandruff yet... So we approve. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I've used this shampoo for about a week now, and it's doing pretty well. I have color treated hair, so I was worried about color fading, but my color is fine and my scalp feels SO much better than before I started using this product! I really enjoy the mint smell, it's not overpowering, and it just smells fresh! So far, so good! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Dove is coming out with more products, and the dandruff shampoo is just another product that both men and women look for. After using the shampoo the first time, I noticed my scalp less dry feeling, which lead to less itching, which lead to less dandruff. I was impressed how quickly it helped, and the mint definitely helped me enjoy the process of washing my hair. If anyone out there hates having scalp massages, you are missing out, but the mint gives the scalp a nice tingling sensation while you move through your hair, and it encourages you to massage as you go. The only thing I didn't find to be much help was frizz control. I have lost a lot of hair within the last year, and now all the baby hair is coming in, and causing mad chaos on my head. While it didn't help control it as I would like, it didn't make it worse. I will be using this product till it's gone, and I will be looking for it on the shelves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I was excited to receive this product. I have dry skin/scalp and have tried everything out there . This shampoo was gentle. Didn't seem to be striping or harsh like most products for dandruff or dry skin. Smells amazing. I recommend this shampoo for both men and women. Seems to relieve the irritation quickly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "My boyfriend and I have been using for a week or more and it invigorates our scalp sand keeps it moisturized , we like the shampoo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I love this. It slightly tingles and left my hair super shiney!!  Before you get this product you need to know it smells amazing! It feels great and does everything you need it to for dandruff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I don't know what to think about this product.  The consistency of the product is between shampoo and conditioner, a bit thicker than shampoo should be.  Then the mint hit you and you think, who put toothpaste in my shampoo?  It was nice and tingly but strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will keep using it for another few days and see what my scalp feels afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I really like this shampoo.  My hair is nice and shiny and my scalp feels good.  I will continue to use this forever, I believe.\n",
      "I started using this shampoo like a week ago and the first time I used it, I woke up to a really really dry and itchy scalp. I constantly scratch my scalp during the day. I don’t recommend this product at all.\n",
      "I opted into the Dove Shampoo and Conditioner  campaign because my 11 yr old daughter has a serious problem with dandruff and itchy scalp, so I couldn't help but wonder if this product could do the trick. Most products similar to this come as one shampoo and conditioner in the same bottle, so I was very lead on by the fact that there was a separate bottle for conditioner ONLY. After using only once her itching stopped and after two uses there was a significant decrease in dryness, not to mention it smells GREAT! I would highly recommend this product to others to others!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "First I must admit that I don't have flakes nor irritation, however I still tried the products and was amazed how hydrated my dry scalp felt. The aroma of both the shampoo and conditioner irritated my sinuses a bit. Not to the point where as I won't continue to use them, because I loved the way my scalp felt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I've tried dandruff/dry scalp  shampoos in the past and have found the scent of the shampoos to be less than desirable.  Not the case with Dove Dermacare!  The feeling on the scalp while washing was refreshing and the scent was pleasing - not too overpowering.  I will definitely be telling others about this product - highly recommended. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "To my surprise I really ended up liking this shampoo and conditioner combo, I did not have high hopes because I usually splurge and buy saloon shampoo. I have been using this for over a week and my hair feels and looks great. My scalp is less itchy and even less frizz after I dry it. Another plus is the smell is great , not perfume like at all which I hate in hair products, it is a light fresh scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Love it! I recommend it! My hair now is more shiny than before also stops my itchy head. I will probably  purchase this products again. 3 thumbs up for this products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "My husband and I both tried the Dove DermaCare Scalp Dryness &Itch Relief Shampoo and Conditioner. I liked the fresh scent. The conditioner relieved the tangled mess left by the shampoo. It helped with the frizz I usually have They decreased my scalp itch but I haven't had them long enough to say it's gone. My husband had a different expierence. He had no relief of his dandruff, he felt like the conditioner was heavy, and was not excited by the product, thus the rating of a 3. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

Too good to be true, maybe. For this tiny 8.45 oz bottle you'll end up paying more per ounce than if you pick one up at the store. I know, technically it was my own fault as a customer on some level, but I'm a little tired of being duped by companies making their products smaller and smaller. Is their overhead getting higher? Are the materials costing more?  Blame what you will, I suspect it's greed.\n",

      "I know that the selling point to this conditioner is to help relieve a dry, itch scalp, but I would buy it just for the smell alone. It smells wonderful. Slightly sweet, but not in that overly sweet, sickeningly way. There is a slight scent of almond, but it isn't too prominent.  I usually use really think conditioners, or else they aren't effective, but this left my hair surprisingly soft, without being greasy. The only downside is that I didn't feel that it was any more effective at calming down my itch scalp. It worked for a day or two, but I've used products that have stopped it all together.  If you use it daily, you might have better results.\n",

It dies smell heavenly though and even makes my thin and fine hair look great. I can not however use this without the same conditioner in order to get the right balance for my hair.\n",

Even with washing my hair with another shampoo, it took another day or two for the stickiness to go away. DO NOT BUY THIS.\n",

      "This product smells like complete and total garbage and strips the color from your hair. So I don’t recommend if you have color treated hair. I would recommend it for men or women purposefully trying to remove the color from their hair. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

      "This conditioner is by far my new favorite I'm not sure if it's the caffeine in it or what but compared to the other head and shoulders it's amazing!  10/10 would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "THIS STILL HAS THAT DISGUSTING SMELL that is indicative of selenium sulfide products. The H&S website said that this wouldn't be a problem. Not true! The smell stays for days and everyone around you can easily smell it too. Believe me, it's not a pleasant smell. I Won't even use it because of the smell and as a favor to everyone around me.\n",

      "You gotta love your Head and Shoulders\n",
      "I’ve been dealing with dandruff all winter long and I tried this out and kid you not, I haven’t seen any dandruff since!! Highly recommend\n",
      "I've been using the Dove DermaCare Conditioner for a week now. I absolutely love the smell but it feels very heavy when applied. I love how soft my hair was after drying and styling but it did leave my hair a bit greasy. I would recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This shampoo is awesome.  It is invigorating and smells really good.   I would definitely recommend this shampoo to buy ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "So I used the Dove DermaCare Scalp Dryness & Itch Relief Conditioner this morning, and I actually liked a few things about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, it is a thick and creamy conditioner, but surprisingly, it isn't greasy. Be careful though, you only need a little. I squirted out WAY too much and I maybe only needed half of what I had in my hand.  I have mid-back length somewhat thin hair, and a little goes a LONG way, which is nice because I see extra value there. I used a majority of the product on the bottom half of my hair, while only massaging a small amount into my scalp so I could test the effectiveness of the \"Scalp Dryness & Itch Relief\" part of the name. The product is moisturizing to my scalp and it doesn't feel dry or itchy at all after I used this. Some other leading dandruff brands only enable me to use them a few times a week max because they tend to dry out my scalp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing I liked is the smell, which I noticed immediately once it came out of the bottle. It is clean and refreshing. I also liked that the smell stayed in my hair afterwards too. I could faintly smell it while I was  styling my hair, so that was another bonus. It isn't an overwhelming smell, but just a nice lasting sense of cleanliness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, Dove products seem to have made their way back into my normal routine. This conditioner is no exception. I would definitely recommend giving this a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I tried it and thought it was great. I will be buying this instead of my old shampoo. I recommend that people buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "After I received this product i wanted to see after three days if it feels the same each time I noticed a cool but refreshing feeling on my sculp and the smell was awesume too I used the regular head and shoulders too and they both do a excellent job I would recommend this for anyone to try so please try it and tell me if I'm telling the truth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This shampoo smells so good! It makes you feel so clean and refreshed! I loved the way it made my hair feel. Soft, clean, and light- not weighed down at all. My hair is very fine and this hair product didn't leave my hair oily like most other products do. I definitely recommend this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Recommend if you have dandfuff\n",
      "You want find anything better than the one I'm using at all\n",
      "This shampoo is ideal for all of us.Despite of the smell that has the perfect one it also do my hair textured, shiny and smooth.I recommend it for all of you!\n",
      "This product starts out smelling like cucumber and morphs into something like cupcake. Hair should smell faintly like flowers or spices or not at all. My dermatologist recommended H&S and I purchased it thinking that since it had medicinal properties they would have avoided heavy scents. I and I'd bet most purchasers avoid heavy scents because of allergies or sensitivities.\n",
      "I really love this product it smells really good and it does what the bottle says i love it and i would recomend it to anyone who loves old spice\n",
      "This product works great. I have never used it until about a month ago. I have definitely seen an improvement and would definitely recommend getting it.\n",
      "This shampoo was decent. Not my fave. I love the smell. If you have color treated hair stay away from it. The conditioner is way way better.\n",
      "This product smells amazing and it lasts. its a tad bit drying but i would recommend to oily hair. I tested Head & Shoulders for free, but all opinions are your own.\n",
      "Winter tends to dry me out.  My hair can often\n",
      "Be dry and frizzy.  This conditioner left my hair very soft and manageable. The scent was very pleasant and applied and rinsed well.  I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This is a great product it was my first time trying it out , and left my hair feeling great . Not only does it give you a great shine it also gives your hair some volume . I recommend this product on my friends and family!\n",
      "Recommended by my dermatologist & I've been using it ever since...\n",
      "This product moisturizes scalp to help with dandruff. It also smells much better than a lot of dandruff shampoos that usually have a chemical smell. I definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "When i first tried this I though it was gonna be like all the others that I have tried before.   I was wrong!!!  This shampoo lathers up so nicely and smells great.  It left my hair feeling wonderful.  I would highly recommend it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "The smell is fantastic, which is really important to me. My scalp definitely becomes more dry in the winter months, but I don't suffer from too much dandruff. With just a few uses, I have noticed mild improvement in my winterized scalp. This product also makes my hair oh, so soft. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I received a bottle of this conditioner for free to try for testing purposes and it really works. I have tough to manage tangles. This conditioner knocked out the tangles in an instant and made my hair soft and manageable again. I would definitely recommend it!\n",
      "This shampoo is great!  No flaking, shiny hair.  Highly recommend!!\n",
      "Recommend!\n",
      "Fraud. Not only was this garbage not sealed but also the second one was not sealed. I tried it for one day, but it gave me a rash, this stuff is dangerous. AVOID!!!\n",
      "I have only used one time..but when I tell you it was a waste it was omg it did not fit my hair type..and I think I was not thinking but it's satifying lol..\n",

      "I like the smell and at first I liked the shampoo but then my hair dried out really bad. Withy hair type and texture I would probably not purchase this type again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "So when this says volume me boost, they really mean it. Although I have thick hair islets surprisingly flat. This gave my hair a lot of volume and full appearance. My husband even noticed. I definitely would buy this product again but I'd recommend to a few people I know. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Finding a shampoo for oily hair isn't easy, and I like this one for my hair.  Not in most stores either.\n",
      "I have thick natural kinky curly hair and Dove DermaCare Scalp Dryness & Itch Relief Shampoo left it smelling fabulous for several days.. usually after the first day my scalp would feel dry and itchy and I'd have to apply a moisturizing cream but with this product that didn't happen. A definite winner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "This pairs perfectly with the matching shampoo. The shampoo cleared up my dandruff & psoriasis. I have very long, thick hair. This moisturizes my hair perfectly and helps to detangle. I apply it from roots to the ends and it doesn't weigh my hair down. It also has a nice apple scent, not the normal medicinal smell that most dandruff products have. I recieved this product free for review but all of my opinions are my own.\n",
      "I have very thick and curly hair. This conditioner worked so well for it and when it dried I had no frizz or dandruff. I love this conditioner and shampoo set. They are amazing together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I love the scent and consistency of the Head and Shoulders Green Apple Conditioner. However, I did give it a 4 out of 5 because by the end of the day my fine/thick hair looked greasy. I received this product for free to test and review.\n",
      "The smell is wonderful and fresh! The problem I had was it didn't remove all hairspray buildup in my hair. I washed it twice and it was still there. If you have thinner hair and not too much products this is for you.\n",
      "I started using this product in place of my other hair products. in 3 days i saw that my curly hair was getting bouncy and shiny again. i have been struggling with my hair for over 4 months now but i think i found the product that will stick with me from now on!\n",
      "The only shampoo I can use without breaking out bro a rash.  Unfortunately, somewhat drying for my baby fine hair.\n",
      "My hair didn't really have much volume but it smelt ok but it wasn't the best it did lather ok after a few seconds it was for both dry and oily scalp it wasn't the best but wasn't the worst I personally wouldn't buy it again\n",
      "Bought like a a couple of years ago and it really gave my hair volumes and it will leave a lovely smell to it\n",

      "I would rate this product a 5. I have tried a lot of shampoos in my time, but this one really delivers what it claims it does. My hair felt different after I used it.

I will continue to use it until either the bottle is gone, I find something better or enough people accuse me of smelling like gasoline. My hair has been air drying for about four hours and I keep smelling petroleum like fumes. I used a deep conditioner afterwards and leave-in conditioner. The smell of this stuff overpowers any other products I’ve added after the shampoo. It might be a dealbreaker. We’ll see!\n",

Even with my routine of not washing my hair everyday and using product, after using this conditioner it was so easy to brush through and when my hair dried I could easily run my fingers through. I really enjoyed the smell as well! It wasn't overwhelming, and had a nice floral scent. I will definitely continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",

I used to use only high end organic products until I tried this out as a free sample. Now I am a complete convert. I will be buying this again. My hair is soft and shiny and no more embarrassing flakes. I used to think all head and shoulders smelled like my dad, but not this one. The sent is really refreshing and smells high end. Can't say enough about this conditioner.\n",

      "My main question about this product was, would it work for my natural hair. I need a product that moisturizes and doesn't leave any build up. I really like this product for my natural hair.

      "will buy again\n",
      "This is a great product. I have very dry scalp, and this was gentle enough to use every day which I did. I saw results after the third use. I could run my fingers through my hair with minimal tangles right after using this conditioner in combination with the shampoo. The smell is fantastic. I could still smell the scent after a full day. I also got complimented on the perfume I was wearing but I had to explain it was my shampoo and conditioner. I would definitely buy this product again. I receive this product complimentary from influenster, but all opinions on the product on my own.\n",
      "This is a very rich and luxurious shampoo and conditioner in 1. I normally like the 2 in 1's cause they don't leave my hair feeling like I put any conditioner in my hair, this one does.

      "Members of our family have been using Head and Shoulders shampoos for a long time.  It has always been a solid performer in the dandruff control department and this new formula is just as effective as the one that has been around forever.  32 ounces is a BIG bottle.  It's a bit heavy and may be difficult to wrangle for someone who has small or frail hands.  It does have a convenient pump on top that allows one to get the product they need without lifting the bottle.  Same fresh fragrance we've been accustomed to for the last couple of decades.\n",

This was the next in line and is terrible. The smell is terrible and is the exact reason I never used Head & Shoulders Shampoo Clinical Strength. I can’t wait to go home wash this smell away.\n",

I used to use the regular Heads and Shoulders shampoo when he was a baby and had seborrheic dermatitis much worse than now, and it worked back then as well.  For this formulation he likes the tingly sensation.  Smells nice and doesn't irritate.\n",
